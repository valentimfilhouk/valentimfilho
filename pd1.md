## Introduction to Algorithms and Python

- **Description**: Explored fundamental programming concepts and basic algorithms, including sorting, recursion, and data structures. Gained hands-on experience with Python for solving computational problems.  
- **Key Skills**: Algorithm design, problem-solving, debugging, and computational thinking.  
- **Key Projects**:  
  - Implemented sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort) to analyze their time complexity and apply them to biological datasets.  
  - Built a Python script to automate the organization of genomic data files, saving time in downstream analyses.  
  - Developed a function to calculate statistical metrics (mean, median, standard deviation) for large datasets, such as RNA-seq or proteomic data.
